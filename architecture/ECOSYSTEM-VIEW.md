#Openline Ecosystem 

The openline ecosystem is composed out of 3 main parts : Customer OS, Components and Applications.

## Customer OS
A collection of Services that offer a simple standard of interacting with Customer data. These services are built on top of multiple types of datasources and offer a complete view of the customer journey. 

## Components
In order to make it easier to interact with the Customer OS, we are proposing a set of most needed components in the interactions with your customers: Forms, Authentication, Conversation Views etc. 

## Applications
Using the components and our Customer OS you can build applications faster and then you can then register them in Customer OS to have access to all your customer data.
